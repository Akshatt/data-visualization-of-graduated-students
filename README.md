# Description 

This project was done under my mentor Prof. Lakshmi Kurup. We have visualized certain factors of students who graduated from my department over the last few years. These factors include:
- CGPA  
- Sex ratio  
- Internships  
- Post Graduation field

We wanted to study and analyze the trends related to these factors hoping to find some facts which might be useful to new students giving them an idea of how the graduated students opted for hgiher studies, placements, etc. 

## Tools 

We used Tableau and Highcharts to visualize the data that we had collected.   
The website was hosted using Github Pages.  
You can see it [here](https://akshatt.github.io/data-visualization-of-graduated-students/).
 
## Analysis

Following interesting facts or trends were found:
- Number of students getting good grades(O and A) has increased by more than twice the amount observed in 2017.   
- Number of students getting lower than average grades(B and C) has decreased by around 40% as noted in the base year.  
- The total number of female students have decreased while their average grades have increased.  
- Around half of the students with top grade(O) have atleast 1 internship, while the others don't have any internships.
- Students with top grade(O) are more inclined towards higher studies than placements.  
- Students having grades other than grade (O), have opted for placements more than higher studies in the last few years.
